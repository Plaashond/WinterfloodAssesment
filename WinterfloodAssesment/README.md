## notes:
- what would a booking consist of?
	- starte and end date of booking
	- booking type(apartments,vehicles,shows)
	- all assets are always available
	- no persistence needed
	- need to store in the runtime session
	- basic

	- Extendable
	- Maintainable
- How?
	- SOLID
	- Factory?
	- Abstract for validation.
	- DI
